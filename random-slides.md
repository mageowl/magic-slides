# Magic Slides

### Effortlessly Made Slide Decks

---

## Magic Slides will auto-generate a slideshow!

It works by using a [markdown](https://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) file, which means you can have **bold**, _italic_, or ~~striked text~~.  
Then you can print it out, or export it as a file or pdf document. To write a slide deck, just type plain text into a .md file.  
Then, separate your slides with `---` (three dashes in a row). Make sure to put it in it's own paragraph.

<style>
	.slide {
		background: #ff6640;
		color: white;
		box-shadow: 0 0 8px 4px rgba(90, 35, 35, 0.146);
	}
</style>

## If you don't like it, change it!

This slide is red. Isn't that cool?
